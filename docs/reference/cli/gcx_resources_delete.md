## gcx resources delete

Delete resources from Grafana

### Synopsis

Delete resources from Grafana by selector or from local files. Use --dry-run to preview changes. Use --yes to skip confirmation prompts. Use --force to delete all resources of a given type.

```
gcx resources delete [RESOURCE_SELECTOR]... [flags]
```

### Examples

```

	# Delete a single dashboard
	gcx resources delete dashboards/some-dashboard

	# Delete multiple dashboards
	gcx resources delete dashboards/some-dashboard,other-dashboard

	# Delete a dashboard and a folder
	gcx resources delete dashboards/some-dashboard folders/some-folder

	# Delete every dashboard
	gcx resources delete dashboards --force

	# Delete every resource defined in the given directory
	gcx resources delete -p ./unwanted-resources/

	# Delete every dashboard defined in the given directory
	gcx resources delete -p ./unwanted-resources/ dashboard

	# Delete all dashboards with auto-approval
	gcx resources delete dashboards --yes

	# Delete all dashboards using environment variable
	GCX_AUTO_APPROVE=1 gcx resources delete dashboards

	# Provider-backed resource types (SLO, Synthetic Monitoring, Alerting):

	gcx resources delete slo/my-slo-uuid
	gcx resources delete checks/my-check-uuid
	gcx resources delete rules/my-rule-uuid

```

### Options

```
      --assume-server-dry-run strings   Assert that the given resources honor server-side dry-run, augmenting the built-in allowlist. Repeatable or comma-separated, each value a GroupResource string (<resource>.<group>), e.g. alertrules.rules.alerting.grafana.app
      --dry-run                         If set, the delete operation will be simulated
      --force                           Delete all resources of the specified resource types
  -h, --help                            help for delete
      --max-concurrent int              Maximum number of concurrent operations (default 10)
      --on-error string                 How to handle errors during resource operations:
                                          ignore — continue processing all resources and exit 0
                                          fail   — continue processing all resources and exit 1 if any failed (default)
                                          abort  — stop on the first error and exit 1 (default "fail")
  -p, --path strings                    Path on disk containing the resources to delete
  -y, --yes                             Auto-approve destructive operations (automatically enables --force)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --agent                       Enable agent mode (JSON output, no color). Auto-detected from CLAUDECODE, CLAUDE_CODE, CURSOR_AGENT, GITHUB_COPILOT, AMAZON_Q, or GCX_AGENT_MODE env vars.
      --config string               Path to the configuration file to use
      --context string              Name of the context to use
      --insecure-log-http-payload   Log full HTTP request/response bodies including raw credentials, authorization tokens, cookies, and OAuth refresh tokens. Do not ship these logs.
      --no-color                    Disable color output
      --no-truncate                 Disable table column truncation (auto-enabled when stdout is piped)
