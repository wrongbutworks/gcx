## Unreleased

- **Breaking:** `gcx fleet` and `gcx instrumentation` now reach Fleet Management
  through the `grafana-collector-app` plugin proxy using your Grafana credential
  (OAuth included) instead of a direct Fleet Management API call. A context that
  carried only a Fleet Management / Cloud access-policy token — with no Grafana
  credential — no longer works for these commands; `cloud.token` /
  `GRAFANA_CLOUD_TOKEN` and `AgentManagementInstanceURL`/`ID` are no longer
  consulted. Reads require the Viewer role; mutations require the Grafana Admin
  role. No Cloud access-policy token is required.


## v0.4.3 (2026-07-01)

- Query: fall back to `/api/ds/query` on any non-200 from the k8s query API
- Pyroscope: default the metrics query step from the datasource config
- Knowledge Graph: apply the selected time range to entity scopes lookup
- Agent mode: mark cloud-only commands via new `agent.availability` annotation
- Windows: open OAuth browser via `explorer.exe` so the login URL survives
- CI: auto-publish the Homebrew formula and drop dead docs jobs


## v0.4.2 (2026-06-29)

- Add Athena datasource provider (query, list catalogs/databases/tables, describe-table)
- Introduce shared SQL query package, refactoring ClickHouse onto it
- Synthetic Monitoring now syncs via a Grafana datasource proxy client
- Set X-Grafana-Caller-Id header on all datasource queries
- Refine output formatting (format and jq handling)
- Remove obsolete publish-technical-documentation workflows


## Unreleased

## v0.4.1 (2026-06-23)

- **Breaking:** `--log-http-payload` has been renamed to `--insecure-log-http-payload`. The old flag name now exits with an error naming the replacement. Payload-dump behavior is unchanged — credentials, cookies, OAuth refresh tokens, and request bodies still appear in the dump when the flag is set. A startup warning is now printed to stderr when the flag is active.
- **Breaking:** `gcx dev serve --address` now defaults to `127.0.0.1` (loopback) instead of `0.0.0.0`. Users who need LAN or remote access should pass `--address 0.0.0.0` explicitly. The WebSocket livereload endpoint now rejects cross-origin requests from hosts other than `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, or the configured listen address.
- **Soft-breaking:** Custom Rego rules loaded via `gcx dev lint --rules` can no longer call `http.send`, any `net.*` builtin, or `opa.runtime`. No flag is provided to re-enable them. Bundled rules are unaffected.
- Added `--jq` for inline JSON transformation and improved agent-mode hints.
- Added OAuth login support for agent and non-interactive workflows.
- Improved config performance with lazy keychain checks and StackID caching.
- Moved stack management under the `gcx cloud stacks` command group.
- Added App O11y service list, get, map, and operation breakdown commands.
- Added Instrumentation Hub `gcx instrumentation check` diagnostics.
- Expanded Assistant investigations with Lodestone v2 capability detection.
- Expanded Knowledge Graph diagnose, meta metrics, and model-rules support.
- Improved IRM incident filtering, paging, and OnCall escalation output.
- Added metrics instant-query timestamps and richer Tempo tag-value output.
- Hardened local debug surfaces and JSON error output for agent workflows.

## v0.4.0 (2026-06-02)

- Added `gcx assistant conversation list` and `gcx assistant conversation get` to inspect Assistant conversations and transcripts.
- Added support for continuing accessible non-CLI Assistant conversations by context ID, with a warning when the source is not CLI.
- Added automatic migration of token-shaped config secrets into the OS keychain, with plaintext fallback when the keychain is unavailable.
- **Breaking**: renamed `gcx kg rules` to `gcx kg prom-rules` to align with `model-rules` and `relabel-rules`.
- Added read-only `gcx kg relabel-rules get` for prologue, epilogue, and generated rule groups.
- Fixed `kg diagnose` verdicts so failing checks no longer report a healthy service, and reclassify scoped no-data checks as label-scope warnings when unscoped data exists.
- Shared Grafana datasource query transport and dataframe wire types across ClickHouse, InfluxDB, and Infinity clients.
- Hardened Claude GitHub Actions secret handling by scoping Vault outputs and restricting `@claude` triggers to trusted repository associations.
- Improved agent guidance for dashboard workflows and Tempo trace analysis, including recommending `gcx traces get --llm -o json` for full-trace analysis.
- Removed several small direct dependencies in favor of internal implementations.

## v0.3.0 (2026-05-26)

- Added ClickHouse, CloudWatch, and Infinity datasource providers.
- Added richer IRM OnCall alert groups and SRE triage tooling.
